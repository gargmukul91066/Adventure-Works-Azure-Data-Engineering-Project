# 🚀 End-to-End Data Engineering Project on Azure

## 📄 Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to build a **full-scale data engineering solution** on **Microsoft Azure**. It processes raw data from the **AdventureWorks dataset** (sourced from GitHub) and moves it through **ingestion, transformation, warehousing, and visualization** stages.  

The solution leverages services like **Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics,** and **Power BI** to prepare and deliver high-quality data for **reporting and business insights**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main objective of this project is to **showcase end-to-end data engineering skills** by building a pipeline that transforms raw data into **analytics-ready datasets**. This includes:  

- Ingesting raw datasets into Azure Storage (Bronze layer)  
- Cleaning and transforming data in **Databricks** (Silver layer)  
- Structuring and optimizing data in **Azure Synapse Analytics** (Gold layer)  
- Delivering **actionable insights** through **Power BI dashboards**  

The project highlights how modern businesses can leverage **Azure’s ecosystem** to enable **data-driven decision-making**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Cloud Platforms:** Azure (ADF, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, Storage Account)  
- **Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines, Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold), Data Lakehouse  
- **Programming & Querying:** Python (Pandas, PySpark), SQL  
- **Data Formats & Storage:** CSV, Parquet, Delta Lake  
- **Visualization & BI:** Power BI  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Step 1: Provisioning Azure Resources ⚙️

The project starts with setting up the core Azure services:  

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Workflow automation and orchestration  
- **Azure Storage Account:** Data lake with **Bronze, Silver, and Gold** zones  
- **Azure Databricks:** For scalable data transformations  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Data warehousing and analytics  

All resources are secured with proper **IAM roles** to ensure safe and seamless integration.

### Step 2: Data Ingestion with ADF 🚀

**Azure Data Factory** orchestrates ingestion from GitHub into the **Bronze layer**:  

- Implemented **Dynamic Copy Activity** with HTTP connectors  
- Added **pipeline parameters** for adaptability  
- Ensured all raw data is stored in the Bronze container

### Step 3: Transformations in Azure Databricks 🔄

**Databricks** cleans and standardizes the raw data for the **Silver layer**:  

- **Cluster Setup:** Efficient distributed processing  
- **Data Lake Integration:** Seamless access to Bronze data  
- **Transformations:**  
  - Data cleaning (null removal, invalid record fixes)  
  - Standardized formats (dates, categories)  
  - Saved as **Parquet** for optimized performance

### Step 4: Warehousing with Azure Synapse Analytics 📊

**Synapse Analytics** prepares the Silver data for BI:  

- Connected to Silver container for querying  
- Used **serverless SQL pools** for cost-efficient queries  
- Created **databases, schemas, external tables, and views**  
- Curated data moved to **Gold layer** for reporting

### Step 5: Business Intelligence with Power BI 📈

**Power BI** connects to Synapse to deliver interactive dashboards:  

- Direct access to curated Gold data  
- Designed reports showing sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance  
- Provided actionable insights for stakeholders
